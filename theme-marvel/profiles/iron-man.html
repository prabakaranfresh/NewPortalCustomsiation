        <h4>Cool Exec</h4>

        <p>Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry business after his parents’ untimely
          deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile
          for the U.S. military, Stark’s convoy came under fire by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and he was
          severely wounded. Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel near
          his heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had
          inserted a powerful electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would prolong it temporarily.</p>

        <p>Stalling his captors after they demanded he build them a new weapon, Stark replaced the magnet with the RT, a
          miniature version of a device originally designed by his father, the Arc Reactor. Furthermore, he and Yinsen
          created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the means with which to escape. The suit worked as
          planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to allow Tony enough time to power it up to fight their
          terrorist captors.</p>

        <p>With help from his friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes, the inventor returned home and promptly announced Stark
          Industries departure from the weapons business. His personal assistant Pepper Potts backed the sudden course
          reversal, but his father’s old friend and business partner, Obadiah Stane, strongly disagreed with what he saw
          as a rash decision.</p>

        <p>Stark worked overtime in his lab to streamline the armor, and when he’d finished, a new persona emerged: Iron
          Man. After he discovered Stane had illegally sold Stark weapons to the Ten Rings, he donned the armor to
          return to Afghanistan and stop the group from using them. Later, he also learned that Stane had paid the Ten
          Rings to kill him and had been working behind Stark’s back to steal the entire company. The older man then
          forcibly took the RT from Tony’s chest and left his old friend’s son to die. But, Potts helped Stark insert
          his original, cobbled-together RT into his chest, and Iron Man flew again.</p>

        <p>Stane presented himself in a gigantic suit of armor of his own, and a battle ensued until Stark and Potts
          overloaded Stane’s power source and Stane died in the process. Feeling more confident in himself than ever
          before, Stark called a press conference soon after the fight and impulsively announced to the world that he
          was indeed Iron Man.</p>

        <h4>Heart of Steel</h4>

        <p>At the very core of the Iron Man technology lies the Arc Reactor. Designed by Howard Stark, but augmented and
          strengthened by Tony Stark, the Reactor provides a clean, manageable energy source with incredible output, one
          that can be adapted to most anything. At first a large piece of equipment, the younger Stark miniaturized the
          technology into the “RT,” which was the size of a human heart, and put it to great use to power his suits of
          armor.</p>

        <p>Iron Man’s armor provided a complete working environment for its user, including enhanced strength, closed
          air systems, data input, communications, flight, defense systems, and offensive weaponry such as missiles,
          lasers, and so-called “repulsor” technology. Stark never stops in his advancement of his armor designs, and at
          one time created multiple versions, each one of them with a specialized use. The armor has also become lighter
          and more flexible since the first incarnation, allowing Stark to “suit up” in mere seconds and be immediately
          ready for action.</p>

        <p>Stark’s latest suit was destroyed in battle with the tyrant Thanos, but while in use sported maximum thrust
          for flight, new offensive weapons, and nanotechnology that allowed near instantaneous application.</p>

        <h4>Stark Raving Enemies</h4>

        <p>Many of Tony Stark’s enemies have stepped out from the shadows to reveal themselves as people connected to
          him in some personal way, making for even tougher challenges for Iron Man.</p>

        <p>Obadiah Stane fools Stark and nearly everyone around him with his vocal desire to see Stark Industries, his
          old friend’s business, succeed and grow. That desire leads to selfish pursuits and the belief that Howard
          Stark’s son would serve Stane’s purposes better dead than alive. His own intellect and scientific prowess
          provide him with the means to build the gigantic “Iron Monger” suit, but his hubris leads to his defeat and
          demise.</p>

        <p>Justin Hammer first appears on the scene as a business rival of Stark’s, and swiftly proves himself
          unreliable, as well as harboring criminal tendencies, like Aldrich Killian after him. They stand as two men
          who could have helped the world to become a better place, but instead fed their own passions and brought an
          ending to their respective stories through their own missteps. Ivan Vanko lusts for revenge on the Starks for
          what he sees as injustices heaped upon his own father, making him something of a darker version of Tony Stark.
        </p>

        <p>In Loki, Thor’s adoptive brother, Stark encounters a foe who seems to wield magic instead of science,
          something that is at odds with the inventor’s entire make-up. To counteract this internal dilemma, Stark
          confronts Loki with his trademark wit and bravado.</p>

        <p>Ultron represents Stark’s hubris in physical form—a robot created by him. Ultron almost immediately advances
          itself past its creator to become Stark’s nightmare: technology he can’t control. Though he and the Avengers
          manage to defeat Ultron, the scars from its birth still show on Stark, perhaps forever.</p>

        <p>More recently, Thanos the tyrant from Titan dominates Stark’s list of enemies and proves to be more than a
          match for the man’s genius and armored strength.</p>

        <h4>Tony’s Heart</h4>

        <p>Some of Tony Stark’s closest friends, allies, and associates are people he works with.</p>

        <p>Pepper Potts began as Stark’s personal assistant. She quickly proves her value to him by essentially making
          sure he survives each day as the owner of Stark Industries, therefore earning his trust to step into the role
          of CEO. On a personal level, the two develop deep feelings for each other that grows into a romance for the
          ages. Tony Stark cannot see his life as anything without Pepper Potts, and he hopes to prove it every single
          day they’re together, through thick and thin.</p>

        <p>Happy Hogan is also an employee that earned his boss’ trust, first as his chauffeur and then as Stark’s head
          of security. Hogan can often exhibit an overzealous nature when it comes to what he sees as taking care of
          Stark, but he would take a bullet for the man and has. The same is true of James Rhodes, who wears a version
          of the Iron Man suit as War Machine/Iron Patriot and has at times been the liaison between Stark Industries
          and the U.S. military. He and Stark’s friendship dates back to their attendance at M.I.T., and it has grown
          into a partnership beyond a common background to mutual admiration, even when each sees the other at their
          worst.</p>

        <p>In the Super Hero community, perhaps the closest friend Tony Stark has is Steve Rogers, Captain America. Tony
          and Steve have had notable ups and down—And even come to blows—and often have differing opinions on how best
          to serve the world community. However, the two men share a strong figure in their histories, Howard Stark, and
          they both possess notable devotion to tasks at hand.</p>

        <p>Tony has also found himself serving as a mentor to Peter Parker, the teenage Super Hero known as Spider-Man.
          Beyond giving the young man updated tech and suits, Tony finds himself dispensing advice to Peter about how to
          best forge his path as a hero and feels protective towards him.</p>
