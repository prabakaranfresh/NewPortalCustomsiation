        <h4>Not Easy Being Green</h4>

        <p>Bioscience genius Dr. Bruce Banner focused his major studies on the effects of gamma radiation on humans,
          working alongside Dr. Betty Ross at a Virginia University lab. Dr. Ross’ father, General “Thunderbolt” Ross of
          the U.S. Army, channeled Banner’s work into a program to develop weapons for the military, unbeknownst to both
          doctors. When Banner decided to test what he learned on himself, he triggered a fantastic transformation in
          himself that resulted in an immense, hulking figure fueled by his own rage.</p>

        <p>Having destroyed his lab as the creature, and inadvertently harming Ross in the process, Banner slipped away
          to avoid capture and study by the Army and began a desperate quest for a cure to his bizarre affliction.</p>

        <h4>Nobody Stronger</h4>

        <p>As intelligent and cerebral as Bruce Banner is, his alter-ego the Hulk is a completely physical phenomenon.
          The green behemoth possesses the greatest raw strength of any natural being on Earth, with an upper limit that
          has yet to be fully tested. His leg muscles allow him to leap great distances and land without harm, and his
          skin can resist damage from heavy weaponry, as well as the natural elements and even unnatural ones.</p>

        <p>The Hulk has grown somewhat more intelligent over the years, beginning with the mind of nearly an infant and
          progressing to what might be described as the personality of a toddler. His speech has increased from growls
          and roars, to one or two words at a time, to full sentences, albeit broken and naïve. Banner recognizes the
          Hulk as himself, but often refers to him as “the other guy,” while his alter-ego seems to have little love or
          respect for the mild scientist and may not even be cognizant that Banner is himself.</p>

        <p>The doctor transforms into the Hulk during moments of stress, anxiety, and most of all anger. The change can
          reverse itself if the Hulk reaches a state of calm, either by himself or through a special mantra utilized by
          his fellow Avengers, most notably Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow.</p>

        <h4>Hulk Smash!</h4>

        <p>Since his battle with the Abomination on the streets of Harlem, New York, the Hulk has tested his mettle
          against a crop of powerful opponents while as an Avenger and on his own. These include the alien Chitauri
          forces and their flying leviathans, the Asgardian trickster Loki, the high-tech soldiers of Hydra, Iron Man’s
          powerful “Hulkbuster” armor, the robotic despot Ultron, and Thor himself in the Sakaarian arenas of the
          Grandmaster.</p>

        <p>While no physical match for the green giant, one might view General “Thunderbolt” Ross as the Hulk’s
          strongest and most persistent foe, in the sense of the man’s dogged pursuit of Banner and his alter-ego and
          his casual willingness to subvert the doctor’s life’s work into weaponry for the U. S. military. In terms of
          sheer power, the tyrant Thanos has given the Hulk a run for his money and bested him in direct combat.</p>

        <p>While the Hulk has faced strong foes before, none so definitively beat him in combat as Thanos, who was able
          to quickly subdue the jade giant when they fought. Hulk’s subsequent refusal to physical manifest himself may
          be due to that encounter, even as Bruce Banner continues the fight against Thanos and his followers.</p>

        <h4>Hulk Make Friend!</h4>

        <p>While at the university at which he did his initial gamma research, Bruce Banner was romantically involved
          with his partner, Dr. Betty Ross. After becoming the Hulk, he seemed to maintain his memory and knowledge of
          the relationship and gravitated toward Betty to protect her from harm. After the Hulk’s first real battle with
          another creature nearly as strong as himself, he was prevented from killing his foe by Betty and fled the area
          without her, which seems to have been the last time they were in contact.</p>

        <p>After allying himself with the Avengers, Banner entered into a complex romantic relationship with Natasha
          Romanoff, the master spy called the Black Widow. At first, Banner resisted his feelings for Romanoff, citing
          his inability to live a normal life as a reason to maintain a platonic partnership with her. The Black Widow
          convinced him otherwise and for a brief moment it seemed the two might find happiness together, before the
          Hulk decided to leave, likely reflecting Banner’s own concerns.</p>

        <p>Both Banner and the Hulk have witnessed a friendship flourish with the Asgardian Thor, a fellow Avenger. At
          first, the two struggled through violent clashes and petty arguments over who was the strongest, but these
          contests led to camaraderie during their time as enslaved gladiators on the planet Sakaar. In Thor, the Hulk
          may have finally found his truest companion.</p>

        <p>Tony Stark has also reached out to Bruce Banner as a peer in the realm of science, and as a man who suffers
          from a debilitation much like he himself once did. Together, the two have worked together on projects
          seemingly as one mind, though Banner has raised objections to what he feels are moral and ethical gaps in
          Stark’s push to advance technology.</p>
