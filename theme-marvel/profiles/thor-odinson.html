        <h4>If I had a Hammer</h4>

        <p>Born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled Asgard, Thor grew into a mighty warrior
          and protector of his home and people. Thought to be rash and even reckless by his father, Thor nevertheless
          looked forward to the day of his ascension to the throne. But, his adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to
          ensure that day never arrived. He manipulated Thor into attacking the Frost Giants, legendary adversaries of
          the Asgardians and Loki’s people, and Odin—hoping to teach his son humility—divested Thor of his magic hammer
          Mjolnir and banished him to Midgard, the realm also known as Earth.</p>

        <p>Alone and unable to return to Asgard, Thor met scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig in the midst of their
          investigation into strange activity near a small New Mexico town. While his brother struggled with the
          limitations of mortals on Earth, Loki worked to ensure his own seizure of the Asgardian throne and planned to
          allow the Frost Giant king—his real father—into Asgard to slay Odin in his sleep. Back on Earth, Thor
          sacrificed himself to save the town from destruction and in doing so, impressed Odin enough to restore him to
          full Asgardian power.</p>

        <p>With Mjolnir once again in his grasp and the admiration and possible love of Jane Foster, Thor returned to
          his home, routed the Frost Giants, and defeated Loki in battle. Chagrined at his loss and stinging from Odin’s
          condemnation, Loki chose to fall away from Asgard into a strange warp in space while Thor and their father
          looked on. Though happy to be back in Asgard, Thor’s thoughts were filled with adventure on Midgard with Jane
          Foster.</p>

        <h4>The Trappings of a God</h4>

        <p>Like all Asgardians, Thor possesses great strength, endurance, stamina, and long life, but it is his command
          over the stormy forces of nature that separate him from his brethren as a true son of Odin the Allfather. Thor
          can call down lightning and thunder at will and utilize them like a blacksmith uses his tools to work iron and
          steel—bending and shaping them into weapons. Once he believed it was his hammer Mjolnir that granted him these
          powers, but in truth the ability has rested within him the whole time.</p>

        <p>For nearly a thousand years Thor holds Mjolnir’s grip in battle, a true companion if ever there was one. The
          incredible hammer was forged by Odin from the heart of a dying star and gifted to his son for his exclusive
          use. Odin even places an enchantment on it when he banishes Thor to Midgard, one that would only allow a
          “worthy” person to lift it and possess the power of the god of thunder. While Thor is with the Avengers on
          Earth, his comrades all try to handle the hammer, but only Captain America could move it slightly, a feat that
          its owner takes notice of.</p>

        <p>After Mjolnir’s destruction by Hela, Thor forges a new weapon when the threat of Thanos arises. With the help
          of Eitri, a Dwarven smithy of Nidavellir, and an adolescent Groot, Thor crafts Stormbreaker, an immense axe
          with some of the same properties as his hammer, along with the ability to open the Bifrost.</p>

        <h4>The Dark Half</h4>

        <p>Thor develops a number of adversaries in his quest to protect Asgard, and also Midgard, from harm.</p>

        <p>The relationship between Thor and Loki may rightfully be categorized as “complicated.” Raised as brothers,
          the two men know each other better than anyone, yet have been continually at odds, sometimes to notably
          extreme degrees. Loki’s scheming nature and unbridled egoism comes between him and Thor many times over,
          causing trouble that has literally impacted entire worlds. Still Thor, overcoming multiple betrayals, believes
          the man he calls brother can change and embrace the light. And it seems Thor’s belief in his is redeemed when
          Loki gives his life to protect Thor from Thanos—leaving Thor to deeply mourn his brother’s loss.</p>

        <p>Among Thor’s more clear-cut enemies stand Frost Giant King Laufey, Surtur the Fire Giant, the dark elf
          Malekith, and Thor’s own half-sister Hela, the so-called goddess of death, all of whom have ill intent towards
          Asgard. Thor also finds himself imprisoned for a time on Sakaar by the Grandmaster.</p>

        <p>Thanos earns Thor’s immense hatred after the tyrant’s crusade wipes out many Asgardians and kills loved ones
          of the god of thunder, making things very personal for him.</p>

        <h4>Warriors All</h4>

        <p>Thor grows up surrounded by warriors and fighters, and it is among that august group that he can count the
          majority of his close companions.</p>

        <p>Heimdall, all-seeing keeper of the Bifrost Bridge, offers Thor advice and counsel whenever he requests it,
          and many times when he does not. Thor treasures his friendship with Heimdall, and they often fight back to
          back against those who threaten their home. Likewise, both Sif and the Warriors Three (Volstagg, Fandral, and
          Hogun) are valued comrades of Thor, battling at his side over the years. They take pride in the fact that they
          always had each other’s backs in a fight, until the Warriors Three perish during Hela’s siege on Asgard.</p>

        <p>On Earth, Jane Foster is a warrior in her own right, a woman who stands up for what she believes in and never
          backs down no matter how big a challenge she faces. These traits impress Thor from the moment he meets the
          young scientist, and their admiration for each other quickly grows into love. Whenever Thor is away from
          Earth, he counts the minutes until he returns to Jane Foster’s side. Unfortunately, the two part ways
          eventually. The Asgardian also feels a bond with Dr. Erik Selvig, Foster’s partner, and he looks to the
          scientist many times for insight not only into deep matters, but also for his knowledge of the world.</p>

        <p>Of all of Thor’s Avengers teammates, Steve Rogers, Captain America, is perhaps the one that he trusts most
          with his life, though he will always remain a faithful companion to the others, including Tony Stark and Bruce
          Banner. The latter, in fact, more recently becomes a closer friend to Thor, as Banner’s alter ego the Hulk
          battles Thor in the gladiatorial arena on Sakaar and fights beside him in Asgard.</p>

        <p>Thor also makes the acquaintance of one of the fabled Valkyrie on Sakaar, a warrior woman self-exiled from
          Asgard and her duties as one of its protectors. Though she at first opposes everything Thor stands for, she
          comes around to his desire to return to Asgard and vanquish its conqueror, Hela. In doing so, she becomes yet
          another staunch ally of the thunder god’s, as does the Kronan named Korg, who also fights with Thor on both
          Sakaar and Asgard.</p>

        <p>While Thor encounters all of the Guardians of the Galaxy, he forges a special bond with Rocket, who
          accompanies him on his journey to create Stormbreaker in order to battle Thanos. Groot, who also joined that
          mission, becomes an ally as well.</p>
