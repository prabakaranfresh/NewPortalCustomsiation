        <h4>Golden Archer</h4>

        <p>Very little is known about the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent known as Hawkeye or his origins. An accomplished combatant
          and weapons master, he was present for Thor’s arrival on Earth, and was impressed with the God of Thunder. He
          was also instrumental in bringing over Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow, to the side of S.H.I.E.L.D, sparing
          her life and offering her a path to redemption.</p>

        <p>For his extraordinary abilities, he was recruited by Nick Fury to be part of the Avengers Initiative.
          Unfortunately, in his first mission with the Avengers, he initially worked against them, thanks his mind being
          controlled by Loki, the Asgardian God of Mischief. After being broken free, however, the horrified Clint did
          work alongside his fellow Super Heroes to bring down the trickster god.</p>

        <p>Since then, he has managed to put his talents to good use against the Chitauri, Ultron, HYDRA, and even his
          fellow Avengers when it seemed necessary.</p>

        <h4>Sniper Mentality</h4>

        <p>As one of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s best agents, the World’s greatest marksman, and an Avenger, Hawkeye uses traditional
          weapons as well as high-tech ones, with a strong affinity for his archery bows. Few humans on the planet
          compare to Clint Barton when it comes to his astonishing talents in precise marksmanship, fighting, flying,
          and tactical prowess.</p>

        <p>An expert acrobat, military-trained combatant, and master assassin, Barton can stand toe-to-toe with some of
          the best fighters around. He is also a master tactician and spy—the Avengers face quite a bit of difficulty
          when Hawkeye works for Loki and turns his plans against them.</p>

        <p>Hawkeye’s specialized equipment include recurve bows, compound bows, a specialized arrow quiver, speed
          loader, Busse dagger, a S.H.I.E.L.D.-issued handgun, and collapsible baton.</p>

        <h4>Target Acquired</h4>

        <p>Plenty of people wind up on the wrong end of Barton’s arrows, especially based on the direct orders of
          S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>

        <p>As he is part of the Avengers Initiative, his enemies are the ones that threaten this group and Earth. He
          faces the likes of the Chitauri, HYDRA, Ultron and his robotic sentries, Ulysses Klaue, in his bid to keep the
          world safe. Hawkeye even battles his fellow heroes when they stand in the way of Captain America and the
          Winter Soldier getting to Siberia, when the Avengers split over the Sokovia Accords.</p>

        <p>His most notable enemy, however, is Loki. With his strong sense of morality, Clint suffers at the thought of
          having worked against S.H.I.E.L.D. and his fellow agents, mourning the losses at his hand. He blames Loki for
          this violation, and the Asgardian prince has earned Barton’s eternal enmity.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <h4>Friends in High Places</h4>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>As an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Clint Barton is allied with many in this organization. He respects and takes
          orders from Nick Fury (unless they contradict his own sense of what is right) and supports colleagues like
          Maria Hill and Phil Coulson.</p>

        <p>His closest friendship is with Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow, who he recruits for S.H.I.E.L.D. They often
          work together on missions and have a strong rapport. Natasha has been known to wear an arrow necklace in honor
          of her friend, and even bargains for his release when he is under Loki’s control. He cannot bring himself to
          fight her properly when they are on opposing sides of the Sokovia Accord dispute. She is also the only agent
          apart from Nick Fury that he entrusts with knowledge of his family (until he brings the Avengers to his
          compound). When Director Fury put the Avengers initiative in place, Barton fights alongside the likes of Iron
          Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and eventually, Ant-Man, Vision, Falcon, War Machine and other heroes. He
          forms a close bond with the Maximoff twins, acting as a mentor when they switch sides to face against Ultron.
          He mentors Scarlet Witch, encouraging her to face her fears and become and Avenger. Pietro Maximoff, AKA
          Quicksilver, even gives his life to save Hawkeye.</p>

        <p>Most important to him, however, are his wife Laura and kids Cooper, Lila and Nathaniel (whose middle name
          “Pietro” reflects the hero’s sacrifice).</p>
